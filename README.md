# GeoQuiz

This is a game for all geography lovers made in C# as Windows Form Application.

In the first window you choose one of four games:
1) Guess the contry (capital or flag is given)
2) Guess the capital (country or flag is given)
3) 4 flags
4) 4 flags

In the first two games, before start you choose a set of continents (initially all are selected) 
and the goal is to guess all the countries from the selected continents in the shortest possible time.

In the other two games, before start you choose the difficulty of the game (easy, medium or hard) and the starting time of the timer
and the goal is to guess as many countries/flags as possible before the time runs out. Each miss reduces the time by 2 seconds.
